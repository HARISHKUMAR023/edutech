It involves working with various technologies and tools, including front-end web development, back-end web development, and database development. And full stack development is a term used to describe a software engineer or developer who works with both the front and back end of a website or application.

It is the only design tool of its type that does this, and in shops that use hardware running different operating systems, everyone can still share, open, and edit Figma files. In many organizations, designers use Macs and developers use Windows PCs. What does Figma do to help bring these groups together? Figmaâ€™s universal nature prevents the annoyance of PNG-pong (where updated images are bounced back and forth between design team disciplines). In Figma, there is no need for a mediating mechanism to make design work available to everyone.',
